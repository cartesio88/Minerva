**************************
* Minerva's How To Install
**************************

At the moment Minerva is only available for GNU/Linux operative systems,
but we expect to port it to other platforms like Windows or Mac OSX.


****************************
* Compile on GNU/Linux
****************************

1/ Minerva has been thought to be easy-instalable. No patchs or hacks are
needed. The first of all is to install the library dependencies:

  $ sudo apt-get install cmake bison++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
  libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev
  libsdl-ttf1.2-dev libcv-dev libhighgui-dev libboost-python-dev freeglut3-dev
  libboost-filesystem-dev


 I hope I did not forget anyone!

2/ Compile some external libraries. These libraries are ARToolKit and Bullet.
Go to the Minerva's root directory, and type:

   $ make libs

 3/ Compile Minerva. Just type:

   $ make


 Finished! If everything went right, we just have Minerva ready to use! If you
downloaded it from the repository, you probably have some examples. From the
root directory try this (you should have a camera in /dev/video0):

   $ ./Minerva examples/ARSheep.mrv


Enjoy your own Augmented Reality Applications!
